      The most well-known French military vintage pants, M-47.
      These had been worn by French army soldiers for almost 20 years, from 1947.
      The best feature of the pants is its beautiful wide silhouette and detailed and sophisticated design. So it is the best combination of ruggedness and French elegance.
</p>
<p>
      The model produced between 1947 and around 1960 is the first generation and the one pproduced in 1960s is the second genearaion. The former has a super wide straight silhouette and the latter is wide tapered. As for material, the first generation uses twill fabric, the second uses herring bone.

       M-52 is chino pants that had been produced in 1950s as French military uniform.  Desptite its wide loose silhouette like M-47, with its double, or single, pleats and slightly tapered shape, you still get a plolished look.
</p>
<p>
      These are high-rise and button fly pants, and the fabric is very hard twill. So if you like very classic details, you gotta love these.
     The model produced in early is the first generation and the one pproduced in late 50s is the second genearaion.  There are a few little differenes between two except the back pockets. The 1st generation has got flap back pockets and the 2nd has no flap.

      <p>
      M-64 is the pants adopted by French air force from 1964 to around 1980s. Since it is actually a successor model of M-47, all the design details are quite similar to M-47. Compared to M-47, the silhouette is tapered and relatively skinnier but loose enough to feel comfortable in.
</p>
<p>
      Another big difference from M-47 is the fabric. M-64 adopted cotton-satin fabric and that shiny look makes it easier for these to match dress items. 
      Also, since its made for air force soldiers, who wore these sitting on their flight, these don't have back pockets.
